This application is one of the two software projects currently under development by the students at 
Enactus UniTS. To learn more about the Enactus student initiative, [check us out](https://enactusunits.it/).

## Description

The aim of this application is to let users find out about the natural and historical gems of the so called _borghi_ 
(small italian villages) located in mountain areas in Italy.

In order to do that, we implemented a point collecting system, which encourages users
to explore the areas around the _borgo_ by displaying all the possible activities on a map. 
Each activity represents a point of interest such as a
panoramic view, mountain top, breathtaking waterfall, ancient building and so on.

In order to complete each activity, users have to physically reach its location. 
When an activity is completed the users earn points, which will then be visible in the personal area.
After that, the completed activities will also be saved in a specific section of the personal area.

## How does it work

In order to use the app, users need to sign up for the service and have an Internet connection.
In the personal area, users will be able to see all the collected points and the completed activities, 
as well as the currently set goal activity.

## Installing the app

Currently, the app is still under development. We haven't published a complete version yet,
but if you're curious, you can check out our nightly builds 
[here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Enactus-Trieste/android-app-borghi).
